<h3> The Original Brief </h3>
<h4>Travel Bucket List</h4>
<b>Build an app to track someone's travel adventures.</b>

<h5>MVP:</h5>
<ul>
<li>The app should allow the user to track countries and cities they want to visit and those they have visited.</li>
<li>The user should be able to create and edit countries</li>
<li>Each country should have one or more cities to visit</li>
<li>The user should be able to create and delete entries for cities</li>
<li>The app should allow the user to mark destinations as visited or still to see</li>
</ul>

<h5>Possible Extensions:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Have separate pages for destinations visited and those still to visit</li>
<li>Add sights to the destination cities</li>
<li>Search for destination by continent, city or country</li>
<li>Any other ideas you might come up with</li>
</ul>
